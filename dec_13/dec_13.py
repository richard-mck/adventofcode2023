"""
You note down the patterns of ash (.) and rocks (#) that you see as you walk (your puzzle input); perhaps by carefully
analyzing these patterns, you can figure out where the mirrors are!

For example:

#.##..##.
..#.##.#.
##......#
##......#
..#.##.#.
..##..##.
#.#.##.#.

#...##..#
#....#..#
..##..###
#####.##.
#####.##.
..##..###
#....#..#

To find the reflection in each pattern, you need to find a perfect reflection across either a horizontal line between
two rows or across a vertical line between two columns.

In the first pattern, the reflection is across a vertical line between two columns; arrows on each of the two columns
point at the line between the columns:

123456789
    ><
#.##..##.
..#.##.#.
##......#
##......#
..#.##.#.
..##..##.
#.#.##.#.
    ><
123456789

In this pattern, the line of reflection is the vertical line between columns 5 and 6. Because the vertical line is not
perfectly in the middle of the pattern, part of the pattern (column 1) has nowhere to reflect onto and can be ignored;
every other column has a reflected column within the pattern and must match exactly: column 2 matches column 9, column
3 matches 8, 4 matches 7, and 5 matches 6.

The second pattern reflects across a horizontal line instead:

1 #...##..# 1
2 #....#..# 2
3 ..##..### 3
4v#####.##.v4
5^#####.##.^5
6 ..##..### 6
7 #....#..# 7

This pattern reflects across the horizontal line between rows 4 and 5. Row 1 would reflect with a hypothetical row 8,
but since that's not in the pattern, row 1 doesn't need to match anything. The remaining rows match: row 2 matches row
7, row 3 matches row 6, and row 4 matches row 5.

To summarize your pattern notes, add up the number of columns to the left of each vertical line of reflection; to that,
also add 100 multiplied by the number of rows above each horizontal line of reflection. In the above example, the first
pattern's vertical line has 5 columns to its left and the second pattern's horizontal line has 4 rows above it, a total
of 405.

Find the line of reflection in each of the patterns in your notes. What number do you get after summarizing all of your
notes?
